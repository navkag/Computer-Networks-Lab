1. Start your TCP client application without the TCP server running. What happens? Why?

Observation: 
The client application fails to establish a connection to the server, resulting in an error message.
Reasoning:
TCP is a connection based protocol, which requires a handshake to be established before any data is
sent from client to the server. In this question, without the server running, a handshake cannot be made, 
so data cannot be sent from the client to the server. 


2. Start your UDP client application without the UDP server running. What happens? Why?

Observation: 
The client application doesn't establish a formal connection to the server. This is evident from the fact
that the client receives no response to its queries.
Reasoning:
UDP is a connectionless protocol and doesn't prioritise data integrity, or in other words doesn't 
require a handshake to be established before any data is sent from client to the server. In this 
question, without the server running, the data sent from the client is lost due to which the client 
never receives a response.
